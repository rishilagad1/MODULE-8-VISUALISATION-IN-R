Module 9-Visualization in R

This week's module taught me about three different types of Visualization Graphics (Basic Graphics, Lattice Graphics, and ggplot2 Graphics) in R.


For this week's assignment, we  create those three types of visualizations on one of the data sets we choose. I chose the data of Gold-silver Price ratio.

I wrote the code and attempted to execute it. After running that code, the expected results are displayed.

The first thing I did was choose my desired dataset and import it into R studio.

> GoldSilver <- read.csv("C:/Users/rushi/Downloads/GoldSilver.csv")
> View(GoldSilver)
> x=read.table(file.choose(),header=TRUE,sep=",")
> plot(x)
> install.packages("lattice")
package ‘lattice’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

The downloaded binary packages are in
C:\Users\rushi\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp2PDFnm\downloaded_packages
> library(lattice)
> xyplot(x)
# Lattice Graphics

 ggplot2:

> install.packages("ggplot2")

> library(ggplot2)

> ggplot(GoldSilver, aes(x=gold,y=silver))+geom_line()


> ggplot(GoldSilver, aes(x=gold,y=silver))+geom_point()






#Thank YOU....
